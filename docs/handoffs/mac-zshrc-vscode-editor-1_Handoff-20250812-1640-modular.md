# mac-zshrc-vscode-editor Handoff Log

## Brief Context

- Enhanced zshrc() to support modular ~/.zshrc.d layout with interactive file selection and safe reload.

## Completed Work

- Updated setup.sh to install a new zshrc() function (v2) with:
  - Editor autodetection (code/subl/mate/bbedit//nano)
  - Interactive selection: main ~/.zshrc, indexes for ~/.zshrc.d/*.zsh, [A]ll, and [S]ecrets
  - Wait + reload ~/.zshrc after editing
  - Convenience aliases: zshrcd, zr
- Updated README.md with modular layout guidance, usage examples, and security note.

## Current State

- Repository contains installer that appends a managed block in ~/.zshrc with markers.
- README documents modular structure and new helper behavior.

## Next Steps

1. Add example snippets for ~/.zshrc minimal bootstrap and ~/.zshrc.d/* templates
2. Optional: add a small shell script to bootstrap ~/.zshrc.d directory with empty files
3. Optional: detect and suggest creating ~/.zsh_secrets with chmod 600
4. CI: none required (local shell utility)

## References

- File: setup.sh (managed block markers: mac-zshrc-vscode-editor zshrc (v2))
- File: README.md (Whatâ€™s New section)

## Notes

- Secrets are never created or modified by installer; user must manage ~/.zsh_secrets permissions (chmod 600).
