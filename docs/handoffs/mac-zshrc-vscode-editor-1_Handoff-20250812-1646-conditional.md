# mac-zshrc-vscode-editor Handoff Log

## Brief Context

- Make zshrc() conditional: interactive only when modular loader is detected; otherwise open ~/.zshrc only.

## Completed Work

- Updated setup.sh embedded zshrc() to:
  - Detect modular layout by scanning ~/.zshrc for references to zshrc.d and ensuring ~/.zshrc.d exists
  - Run interactive selection (indexes, [A], [S]) only when modular
  - Otherwise open only ~/.zshrc
  - Keep editor autodetection and safe reload
- Updated README.md to document conditional behavior.

## Current State

- Running setup.sh appends/updates the managed block in ~/.zshrc.
- zshrc behavior adapts to modular vs non-modular setups.

## Next Steps

1. Add stronger heuristics (e.g., check for numeric-ordered sourcing in loader)
2. Optional: add a bootstrap command to create ~/.zshrc.d with template files
3. Optional: warn if ~/.zsh_secrets exists without chmod 600

- File: setup.sh
- File: README.md

## Notes

- No changes made to user secret files; only detection and optional selection.
